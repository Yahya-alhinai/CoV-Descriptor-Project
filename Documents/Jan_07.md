# Dec 25, 2020 - Image-Integrale functionality added


### RAM module ###
- Image-Integrale module has been added to the RAM module. Image-Integrale produces integral for all of the features found (Gx, Gy, sqrt(), atan2()). This module is located at the RAM module for easy access to previously stored results. It produces results simultaneously once it is given new inputs which add no lanacy to the computation time. Then resutl for each feature from Image-Integrale module is stored in RAM as part of the output array.
